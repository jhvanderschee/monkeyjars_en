I"B<p>In nature, I grow between the trees in the jungle. Itâ€™s the perfect place for me, because my diet consists of small flies and insects. I lure them in with my nectar. When they land on the edge of my pitcher, they can easily slip and fall in. My pitchers are filled with a sticky liquid full of digestive enzymes.</p>
