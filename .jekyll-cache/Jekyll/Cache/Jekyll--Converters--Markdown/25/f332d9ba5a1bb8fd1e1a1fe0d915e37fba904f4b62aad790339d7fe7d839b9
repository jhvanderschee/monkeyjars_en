I".<p>If my pitchers turn brown, then something is wrong. I may have been given too little water or I may be somewhere that is too dry or bright for me. If that is the case, then itâ€™s important for you to quench my thirst or see if you can put me somewhere humid. One thought could be the bathroom!</p>
