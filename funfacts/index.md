oorsprong:
  - title: Where are you from?
    content: >-
      I am originally from the tropical rainforest of Borneo and the surrounding
      area. It can rain very heavily there! That's why I like having a lot of
      water and high air humidity.
  - title: Where do you grow in nature?
    content: >-
      In nature, I grow between the trees in the jungle. It's the perfect place
      for me, because my diet consists of small flies and insects. I lure them
      in with my nectar. When they land on the edge of my pitcher, they can
      easily slip and fall in. My pitchers are filled with a sticky liquid full
      of digestive enzymes.
  - title: Do the pitchers always stay connected to the plant?
    content: >-
      My pitchers can stay connected for years, depending on how well I am cared
      for. If I am not given enough water to drink, my pitchers can dry out
      (turn brown) and die.
  - title: Where did the name Monkey Jars come from?
    content: >-
      Monkeys that swing through the jungle occasionally take a sip of water
      from my pitchers, that's why I was named ‘Monkey Jars’. I am also called
      ‘pitcher plant’. Feel free to call me ‘Monkey Jars’ ;-).

  - title: Can I bring you into the shower with me?
    content: >-
      Yes, that would be absolutely fantastic! Don’t do it too often though and
      please don't use soap on me because it isn't good for me. I also love
      being left to enjoy a nice and humid bathroom.
  - title: Do I really need to put water in your pitchers?
    content: >-
      No, if you take good care of me there is no need for that. Think of my
      stems as an organic sieve. If you give me enough water and the place you
      put me is not too dry, then I will fill my pitchers with a layer of water
      on my own. Depending on which variety of me you choose, I usually fill my
      pitchers to about a third but this is not always the case.
  - title: Why do your pitchers turn brown?
    content: >-
      If my pitchers turn brown, then something is wrong. I may have been given
      too little water or I may be somewhere that is too dry or bright for me.
      If that is the case, then it's important for you to quench my thirst or
      see if you can put me somewhere humid. One thought could be the bathroom!
  - title: 'Can I cut off the brown, dried-out pitchers?'
    content: >-
      Yes, the brown pitchers have died. You can cut them off. It does not
      matter where you cut them, whether at the top of the stem or at the
      bottom. I will then do my best to make new pitchers.
  - title: Do I always need to give you rainwater?
    content: >-
      Rainwater does not contain chalk, and I am not so fond of chalk. That's
      why it's fine to put me outside during a real downpour of rain. Now and
      again, I'm fine with having some tap water!
  - title: How do I know how much water to give?
    content: >-
      I love being the centre of attention ☺. So make sure to check how I'm
      doing and feel the soil I'm in. If I am not turning brown and my soil is
      somewhat damp, then I am happy as can be. To make sure we'll be the best
      of friends, make sure to check how I'm doing regularly when you first get
      me and try to develop an idea of how much water I need. You can use a
      plant sprayer to keep my leaves humid. Please don't overdo it, because too
      much water is bad for my roots and that could kill me!

  - title: Where can I best put my Monkey Jars?
    content: >-
      Just like in the jungle, I like being somewhere light, but direct sunlight
      is too much for me. During the warm summer months, I love being outdoors
      but I still won't like being in direct sunlight.
  - title: Waarom zijn jouw bekers rood van kleur?
    content: >-
      Ik ben een echte Casanova. Met de rode kleur van mijn bekers lok ik
      insecten. Hoe feller de kleur van mijn bekers, hoe meer honger ik heb!
  - title: Wanneer ontstaan er bekers?
    content: >-
      Ik ben een summer dude; in de wintermaanden groei ik langzaam, maar in de
      zomer groeien mijn bladeren een stuk sneller en ontstaan er ook nieuwe
      bekers. De bekers zijn een verlengde van mijn blad.
  - title: Kan ik mijn Monkey Jars verpotten?
    content: >-
      Ik heb een hekel aan verhuizen. Ik hoop dan ook dat je mij lekker in mijn
      vertrouwde potje wil laten zitten. De potgrond is speciaal samengesteld
      voor mij als vleeseter en ik ben er erg aan gehecht.
plantenvoeding:
  - title: Kan ik mijn Monkey Jars kunstmest geven?
    content: >-
      Ja dat kan. Eens in de twee maanden een heel klein beetje. Anders word ik
      misselijk. 1 gram per liter water is voldoende. Zeker als ik te weinig
      insecten heb gegeten, is kunstmest een mooie toevoeging.
  - title: Moet ik mijn Monkey Jars vliegjes te eten geven?
    content: >-
      Nee dat hoeft niet, maar mag wel. Ik probeer zelf mijn vliegjes te vangen.
      Deze verteer ik en daar haal ik weer mineralen uit. Maar als ik jarig ben,
      lust ik best een extra vliegje!
