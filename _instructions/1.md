You probably already know that I hate it when my roots are dry. I'm happiest when you keep my roots damp by adding small amounts of water. Normally, I'll be quite happy if you water me with a watering can twice a week when I am indoors. But that really depends on the situation. Watering me twice a week might be just too much or just not enough. So make sure to check that my soil is always damp. If it is a little dry, I would love another sip of water\!
