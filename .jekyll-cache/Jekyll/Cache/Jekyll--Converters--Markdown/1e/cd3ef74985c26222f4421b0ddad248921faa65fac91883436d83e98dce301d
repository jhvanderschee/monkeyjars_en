I"f<p>No, if you take good care of me there is no need for that. Think of my stems as an organic sieve. If you give me enough water and the place you put me is not too dry, then I will fill my pitchers with a layer of water on my own. Depending on which variety of me you choose, I usually fill my pitchers to about a third but this is not always the case.</p>
