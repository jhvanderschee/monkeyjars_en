I"ý<p>I love being the centre of attention â˜º. So make sure to check how Iâ€™m doing and feel the soil Iâ€™m in. If I am not turning brown and my soil is somewhat damp, then I am happy as can be. To make sure weâ€™ll be the best of friends, make sure to check how Iâ€™m doing regularly when you first get me and try to develop an idea of how much water I need. You can use a plant sprayer to keep my leaves humid. Please donâ€™t overdo it, because too much water is bad for my roots and that could kill me!</p>
