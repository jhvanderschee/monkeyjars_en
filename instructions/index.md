My family and I are from the tropical rainforests of Borneo and the surrounding area, which is nice and humid just how we like it. I understand that a rainforest might be hard to find in colder countries, but the more similar my new home is to a rainforest the happier I will be. I drink a lot. The soil I am in should always be nice and damp. So please make sure I'm nice and comfy by using a plant sprayer on me and regularly giving me plenty to drink\!
